# My Portfolio Website 

This project was created by myself in 2022 as my software developers portfolio, using React, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

## Installation

If you want to emulate the website you are welcome to do so, you just need to install the follwoing packages.

### React

Following the instructions below, replace 'my-app' with the name of your app. This will install the basics for React and startup the live-server.  

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

## Usage

You can create a verison of my website by simply using the code and components that you find within the repository. However, I would suggest using the code as a template only, and learning about how all the various elements combine at the website [REACT-HELP](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)

## Contributing 

As this is a personal website I won't imagine looking at code changes to much from external sources. However, if you have any suggestions I am more than happy to discuss them
